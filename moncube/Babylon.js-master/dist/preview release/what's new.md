    - Introduced new observable system to handle events ([nockawa](https://github.com/nockawa), [deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
    - Added a new VR camera : VRDeviceOrientationArcRotateCamera ([temechon](https://github.com/Temechon))
    - Unity3D exporter: Added support for lightmaps ([davrous](https://github.com/davrous), [deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
    - Unity3D exporter: Added support for export and run (local webserver) ([davrous](https://github.com/davrous), [deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
    - Moved PBR Material to core ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
    - StandardMaterial.maxSimultaneousLights can define how many dynamic lights the material can handle ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
	- Introduced Canvas2D feature: a 2D engine to render primitives, sprites in 2D, text. Canvas2D can be displayed in Screen Space (above the 3D scene) or in World Space to be a part of the Scene. [overview](http://doc.babylonjs.com/overviews/Using_The_Canvas2D), [tutorial](http://doc.babylonjs.com/tutorials/Using_the_Canvas2D) ([nockawa](https://github.com/nockawa))	
  - **Updates**
    - Added postprocess.enablePixelPerfectMode to avoid texture scaling/stretching when dealing with non-power of 2 resolutions. cannot be used on post-processes chain ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
    - Enabled other post processes to be used when also using a 3D Rig ([jcpalmer](https://github.com/Palmer-JC))
    - Added skeleton.getBoneIndexByName(boneName: string) ([dad72](https://github.com/dad72))
    - Added node._children to track children hierarchy ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
    - Added Camera.ForceAttachControlToAlwaysPreventDefault to help embedding Babylon.js in iFrames ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
    - Support for Layer.alphaTest ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
    - New scene.pointerDownPredicate, scene.pointerMovePredicate, scene.pointerUpPredicate to define your own predicates for meshes picking selection ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
    - New OnPickTrigger support for spritesManager ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
    - New SPS method `digest()` ([jerome](https://github.com/jbousquie))    
    - New SPS property `computeBoundingBox` ([jerome](https://github.com/jbousquie))  
    - Added a new OnPickOut trigger fired when you release the pointer button outside of a mesh or sprite. ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
    - Added support for OnPointerOver and OnPointerOut for sprites. ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
    - Added an optional predicate on Node.getDescendants, Node.getChildren to filter out Nodes based on a callback execution. ([nockawa](https://github.com/nockawa))
    - Added Ray.intersectionPlane & intersectionSegment. ([nockawa](https://github.com/nockawa))
    - LinesMesh class now supports Intersection. Added the intersectionThreshold property to set a tolerance margin during intersection with wire lines. ([nockawa](https://github.com/nockawa))
    - Geometry.boundingBias property to enlarge the boundingInfo objects ([nockawa](https://github.com/nockawa))
    - Tools.ExtractMinAndMax & ExtractMinAndMaxIndexed now supports an optional Bias for Extent computation.
	  - Added StringDictionary<T> class to implement an efficient generic typed string dictionary based on Javascript associative array. ([nockawa](https://github.com/nockawa))
	  - Added RectanglePackingMap class to fix several rectangles in a big map in the most optimal way. ([nockawa](https://github.com/nockawa))
	  - Added DynamicFloatArray class to store float32 based elements of a given size (stride) into one big Float32Array, with allocation/free/pack operations to then access an optimal buffer that can be used to update a WebGLBuffer dynamically. ([nockawa](https://github.com/nockawa))
	  - Scene.onPointerObservable property added to enable a unique Observable event for user input (see ArcRotateCamera inputs for examples) ([nockawa](https://github.com/nockawa))
  - **Exporters**
    - Support for 3dsmax 2017 ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
    - Added support for up to 8 bones influences per vertex for 3dsmax exporter ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
    - Added console logging for .babylon file loading ([jcpalmer](https://github.com/Palmer-JC))
  - **API doc**
    - class `SolidParticleSystem` documented ([jerome](https://github.com/jbousquie))
    - class `MeshBuilder` documented ([jerome](https://github.com/jbousquie))
    - class `Mesh` documented ([jerome](https://github.com/jbousquie))
  - **Bug fixes**
    - Fixed bug with billboards and parenting ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
    - Fixed bug with ArcRotateCamera.setTarget ([deltakosh](https://github.com/deltakosh))
    - Fixed bug with OBJ Loader - All meshes were concatenated with the previous one ([Temechon](https://github.com/Temechon))
  - **Breaking changes**
    - `VertexData.CreateLines()` removed as `MeshBuilder.CreateLines()` now calls `MeshBuilder.CreateLineSystem()`
    - `scene.onNewXXXAdded` and `scene.onXXXRemoved` callbacks were removed and replaced by `scene.onNewXXXAddedObservable` and `scene.onXXXRemovedObservable`
    - `Material.dispose` does not dispose textures by default. You have to call `material.dispose(false, true)` to get the previous behavior.
